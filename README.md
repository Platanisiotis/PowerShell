# PowerShell
A PowerShell Repo for functions and scripts I have made and edited while finding them useful in my day to day work.

Commenting at times may seem excessive although it's used for training. This includes detailing at every input or output the data type. ie. String, PowerShell Custom Object, System.DateTime, Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.ADUser.
